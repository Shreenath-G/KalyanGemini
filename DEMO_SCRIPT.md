## Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How does it compare to existing solutions?**
> "Traditional platforms require manual optimization. We use multi-agent AI to automate the entire process - from creative generation to real-time bidding. Our agents work together like a team of specialists, each optimizing their domain."

**Q: What's the cost to run this?**
> "About $1,000/month for 1,000 active campaigns on Google Cloud. That's roughly $1 per campaign per month. The ROI improvement typically pays for itself many times over."

**Q: How do you ensure data security?**
> "We implement defense-in-depth: API key authentication, rate limiting, account-level isolation, TLS 1.3 encryption, and AES-256 at rest. We've conducted comprehensive security testing with 33 tests covering all attack vectors."

**Q: Can it scale?**
> "Absolutely. We've load tested at 10,000 requests/second. Cloud Run auto-scales from 1 to 100 instances. We can handle thousands of concurrent campaigns with sub-100ms bid execution."

**Q: What about AI hallucinations or bad creatives?**
> "Great question! We have multiple safeguards:
> - Compliance validation filters prohibited terms
> - Character limit enforcement
> - Template-based fallbacks if AI fails
> - Human review option for sensitive campaigns
> - Performance monitoring pauses underperformers"

**Q: How long did this take to build?**
> "The complete system with all 6 agents, security, testing, and documentation represents a full development cycle. Google ADK significantly accelerated agent development."

**Q: What's next for the platform?**
> "We're planning:
> - Multi-language support for global campaigns
> - A/B testing framework
> - More platform integrations (LinkedIn, TikTok)
> - Predictive analytics for campaign forecasting
> - Real-time dashboard UI"
